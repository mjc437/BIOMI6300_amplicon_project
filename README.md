# BIOMI6300_amplicon_project
The main goals of this project is to: 
1) Identify a scientific question within the scope of 16S microbial sequencing data.
2) Assign ASVs and taxonomy with DADA2. 
3) Visualize the data and perform (multivariate) statistics to explore the scientific question. 
4) Create a version-controlled GitHub repository where all aspects of the project will be held in a reproducible and open science format. This will includes various analysis, data, code, and figure folders/files.
5) Practice data interpretation to draw conclusions from the visualizations and statistics.

## Overall Scientific Question:
- Is there a difference in the gut microbioata of dog breeds with and without acute diarrhea 
- Can I reproduce the results from 2023 study by Bai et al. titled " Variations in gut microbiome and metabolites of dogs with acute diarrhea in poodles and Labrador retrievers"

## Project Description 
- A total of 48 different fecal samples were collected from dogs.
  - 12 from seemingly healthy Poodles
  - 12 from Poodles with acute diarrhea
  - 12 from seemingly healthy Laboradors
  - 12 from Laboradors with acute diarrhea
- All samples came from dogs that reside in China
